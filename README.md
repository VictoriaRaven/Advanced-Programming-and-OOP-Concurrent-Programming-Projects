## Information

### Advanced Programming Course
Documentation in pdf is at the front based on the topic title section. I did NOT include the source code as this code has an answer key. I poseted my project documentaiton though so you can see what I learned in my projects that is correlated to the OOP and concurrent programming in the next course. Project 1 is about Token, Parser, and Drawings with the GUI shapes to comprehend the CS language. Project 2 is about Extending the C++ for Statements of Expression Language (Tokens, parser, and drawings). Under the copyright and policies of intellectual property for UMGC, I will only upload items that do not have an answer key. OTher information about this is that this is UMGC's advanced programming course, which focuses on building robust and secure software by deeply understanding how programming languages work. It will help define rules and meanings behind different languages, and learn about the underlying systems that allow those languages to run. Practical application is key, as students will work on programming projects using a variety of languages, solidifying their understanding of how to write safe and reliable code.


### OOP and Concurrent Programming
Source codes are in each project directory folder! Documentation in pdf is at the front to avoid conflicts with source code. Project 2 is about OOP and Project 3 is about concurrency and threading! This project uses the OOP and Concurrent Programming Course at UMGC. Since Projects 2 and 3 do not have answer keys and requrie I do my own code, I will only upload these two. Under the copyright and policies of intellectual property for UMGC, I will only upload items that do not have an answer key. Read all comments in the code. Other information is that this course focuses on advanced programming techniques in Java, building upon prior programming knowledge based on object-oriented principles like organizing code through composition and polymorphism, and also tackle concurrent programming concepts. This includes understanding how to manage multiple tasks running simultaneously, avoiding issues like race conditions and deadlocks, and building interactive graphical interfaces. The course emphasizes practical skills through programming projects.
